# Sketch 8: p5 pong

**Create a simple ball bouncing game using p5.js.**

## Rules

1. Fork the sketch on github (also available at http://jsbin.com/jikavil).
2. A score should be visualized; you decide how points are awarded or deducted.
3. The number of lives should be visualized;  the player should have a limited number of lives.
4. Add any other game elements youâ€™d like:
   * Make a change in terms of the static appearance of the game.
   * Change the speed or size of the ball.
   * Change the speed, size or controls of the paddle.
   * Add another paddle.
   * Create another type of bouncing object.
   * Provide a game over screen.
   
## Learning Objectives

- Modify an existing program.
- Reflect on a minimalistic digital game.
- Manage state in a game.
- More practice employing interactivity with p5.js.


When you are finished, reflect in a comment at the top of your sketch
about what you were trying to accomplish with your game.
